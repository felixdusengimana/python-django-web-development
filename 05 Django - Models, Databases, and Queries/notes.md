# SQL vs NoSQL

SQL: stores data in tabular form
NoSQL: stores value in key/value format

### Which is better?

None is better than another. but for django models it works well with tabular db.
You shouldn't choose a db base on that is sound cool but on what you're doing.

# SQL engines

1. MySQL
2. SQLite
3. PostgressSQL
4. MS SQL
5. ....

SQLite is already included with python.

# Models and Database Table

Models are converted into database table.
